  "body": "Hello and welcome to my personal site. This website is currently a work in progress decentralized blog, built on-top of IPFS. To achieve this for the initial prototype I am using a  lightweight, static site, but in future intend to experiment with NoDB solutions.<p>This project can be watched at <a href=’https://github.com/bhayward93/ipfs-blog’>github.com/bhayward93/ipfs-blog</a> , you are also welcome to add features, or fork. The initial plan is to develop a blog, then see how I can best optimize for speed. Nothing particularly interesting in the repository currently, but I intend to create a kind of boilerplate for other people wanting to host their sites on IPFS (along with a tutorial) , or even possibly down the line, turn it into an IPFS blog generator.<p>A bit about me and my background; I have a passion for Blockchain and Web technologies, and work actively on various large scale projects spanning from banks to ICOs. I am a firm believer in the future of cryptocurrencies and am a supporter of the FOSS movement.
